***Living a life rich with purpose!***

A traveler stumbled upon three stonecutters toiling in the sun. He asked the first, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù The man, exhausted and covered in dust, grumbled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cutting stone.‚Äù The second replied with a sense of duty, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making a living for my family.‚Äù The third, despite the sweat, looked up with a twinkle in his eye and declared, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm building a cathedral.‚Äù This simple story shows how purpose transforms ordinary things into something special, a feeling we all seek in our lives.

***Market rewards results, not intentions***

The pursuit of purpose often time seems like a luxury in an era of relentless metrics and short-term goals. Critics might argue that focusing on value over execution, obsession over mission statements, a lofty "why" is inefficient, a distraction from the practical realities of profit margins and career progression. A relentless focus on a grand purpose can lead to burnout or a "purpose-washing" culture where inspiring statements mask a toxic environment. Indeed, a 2023 survey by EY found that while 79% of business leaders believe purpose is central to success, only 34% use it as a guide for decision-making, highlighting a significant disconnect between rhetoric and reality. It's the thought that counts or does it?

Some examples:
- Theranos, founded with the revolutionary purpose of making healthcare accessible through simple blood tests, the company betrayed its mission, collapsing from a $9 billion valuation to zero after it was revealed the technology never worked.
- TOMS, the "One for One" purpose of donating a pair of shoes per sale, overextended its financial model, leading to a 2019 bankruptcy filing with $300 million in debt. They have sinced moved away from this model and now gives 1/3 of their profits for grassroots good.
- Enron, which lost sight of ethical purpose in pursuit of profit, collapsed spectacularly, costing shareholders $74 billion.
- Kodak‚Äôs failure to pivot to digital photography stemmed from an overattachment to its legacy purpose of film-based innovation.

***Intention is the architect of lasting impact***

Purpose-driven organization and leadership is more than a buzzword; it‚Äôs a framework for sustainable success. The concept of 'purpose acts as a strategic filter' echoed in Sun Tzu's "The Art of War," emphasizes that a unified army with a clear objective is far more formidable than one fighting for mere conquest. Purpose provides a "moral law" that unites and motivates. The critique of 'purpose without execution is hollow' often ignores that purpose and pragmatism aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. 

üëâ A well-defined purpose channels desire into disciplined action, balancing vision with results. It is not a destination to be reached, but the compass that guides our journey.

Some examples:
- Patagonia, guided by its purpose to "save our home planet", Patagonia‚Äôs sales grew 400% over a decade, reaching $1.5 billion in 2023, while giving away 1% of its revenue to environmental causes.
- Warby Parker, driven by its purpose to provide "vision for all," the company's "Buy a Pair, Give a Pair" program has helped distribute over 20 million pairs of glasses while growing its revenue to $771.3 million in 2024.
- Etsy, by focusing on its purpose to "Keep Commerce Human," Etsy has empowered millions of sellers and grown into a marketplace with $2.7 billion in revenue for 2023.
- KIND Healthy Snacks, driven by creating value in society, KIND‚Äôs purpose-led approach contributed to a $5 billion valuation upon its 2020 sale to Mars.

These examples underscore that purpose isn‚Äôt just feel-good rhetoric - it‚Äôs a strategic advantage. Here is a fairly recent study evaluating the Return on Purpose ([source](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/11/09/the-return-on-purpose-before-and-during-a-crisis/)):

***An unlived purpose is the most beautiful lie***

This journey towards purpose is intensely personal. The philosopher Socrates famously declared, "The unexamined life is not worth living," urging us to look inward for meaning rather than outward for validation. Modern thinkers echo this, stating, "The reason to do anything is because you want to, not because you're supposed to." This brings me to a framework for understanding our own purpose, often visualized in the Japanese concept of Ikigai; which serves as a reminder that purpose is not a singular, grand discovery but something we create and redefine throughout our lives - harmonious blend of our passions, talents, contributions, and practical needs.

*Malala Yousafzai, at 15, faced a gunman seeking to silence her advocacy for girls‚Äô education. Instead of retreating, she transformed the terror into a global movement, proving purpose can emerge from adversity. Her story reminds us that purpose isn‚Äôt just an ideal but a force that drives growth and thoughtful leadership in a chaotic world. As Socrates said, ‚ÄúWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.‚Äù Purpose, like excellence, is a habit forged through intention, guiding us toward meaningful impact.*

If you are on a spiritual journey or simply curious or both, here is a food for thought - Does a well-meaning, well-defined purpose feel like a trap, freedom restricting, imprisonment i.e. will it make you unhappy until you achieve your purpose?
