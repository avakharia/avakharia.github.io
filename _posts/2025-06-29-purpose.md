***Living a life rich with purpose!***

A traveler stumbled upon three stonecutters toiling in the sun. He asked the first, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù The man, exhausted and covered in dust, grumbled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cutting stone.‚Äù The second replied with a sense of duty, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm making a living for my family.‚Äù The third, despite the sweat, looked up with a twinkle in his eye and declared, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm building a cathedral.‚Äù This simple story shows how purpose transforms ordinary things into something special, a feeling we all seek in our lives.

***Market rewards results, not intentions***

While a noble purpose can feel like a luxury in a results-driven world, the market ultimately rewards concrete outcomes, not just lofty intentions. An excessive focus on "why" without robust execution leads to "purpose-washing" ‚Äî where inspiring statements mask toxic realities or operational failures. For those focused on survival, abstract purpose seems tone-deaf; true value is demonstrated, not just declared.

Some examples:
- Theranos, founded with the revolutionary purpose of making healthcare accessible through simple blood tests, the company betrayed its mission, collapsing from a $9 billion valuation to zero after it was revealed the technology never worked.
- TOMS, the "One for One" purpose of donating a pair of shoes per sale, overextended its financial model, leading to a 2019 bankruptcy filing with $300 million in debt. They have sinced moved away from this model and now gives 1/3 of their profits for grassroots good.
- Enron, which lost sight of ethical purpose in pursuit of profit, collapsed spectacularly, costing shareholders $74 billion.
- Kodak‚Äôs failure to pivot to digital photography stemmed from an overattachment to its legacy purpose of film-based innovation.

***Intention is the architect of lasting impact***

The concept of 'purpose acts as a strategic filter' echoed in Sun Tzu's "The Art of War," (<a href="https://amzn.to/4lGPyLc" target="_blank">amazon</a>) emphasizes that a unified army with a clear objective is far more formidable than one fighting for mere conquest. Purpose provides a "moral law" that unites and motivates.  Even in resource-scarce environments, small acts of purpose, like mentoring a colleague or volunteering, can spark growth.

üëâ A well-defined purpose channels desire into disciplined action, balancing vision with results. It is not a destination to be reached, but the compass that guides our journey.

Some examples:
- Patagonia, guided by its purpose to "save our home planet", Patagonia‚Äôs sales grew 400% over a decade, reaching $1.5 billion in 2023, while giving away 1% of its revenue to environmental causes.
- Warby Parker, driven by its purpose to provide "vision for all," the company's "Buy a Pair, Give a Pair" program has helped distribute over 20 million pairs of glasses while growing its revenue to $771.3 million in 2024.
- Etsy, by focusing on its purpose to "Keep Commerce Human," Etsy has empowered millions of sellers and grown into a marketplace with $2.7 billion in revenue for 2023.
- KIND Healthy Snacks, driven by creating value in society, KIND‚Äôs purpose-led approach contributed to a $5 billion valuation upon its 2020 sale to Mars.

These examples underscore that purpose isn‚Äôt just feel-good rhetoric - it‚Äôs a strategic advantage. Purpose-driven organization and leadership acts as a framework for sustainable success. Here is a fairly recent study evaluating the Return on Purpose ([source](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/11/09/the-return-on-purpose-before-and-during-a-crisis/)):

***An unlived purpose is the most beautiful lie***

The journey towards purpose is intensely personal. The philosopher Socrates famously declared, "The unexamined life is not worth living," urging us to look inward for meaning rather than outward for validation. Modern thinkers echo this, stating, "The reason to do anything is because you want to, not because you're supposed to." This brings me to a framework I came across for understanding our own purpose, often visualized in the Japanese concept of Ikigai (<a href="https://amzn.to/4eV323T" target="_blank">amazon</a>); which serves as a reminder that purpose is not a singular, grand discovery but something we create and redefine throughout our lives - harmonious blend of our passions, talents, contributions, and practical needs.

*Malala Yousafzai, at 15, faced a gunman seeking to silence her advocacy for girls‚Äô education. Instead of retreating, she transformed the terror into a global movement, proving purpose can emerge from adversity. Her story reminds us that purpose isn‚Äôt just an ideal but a force that drives growth and thoughtful leadership in a chaotic world. As Socrates said, ‚ÄúWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.‚Äù Purpose, like excellence, is a habit forged through intention, guiding us toward meaningful impact.*


üéØ Finding the words to describe your purpose may take some time, but if you keep following what pulls you forward and lights you up, you'll be on the right track. Be aware though that you don't have to name your purpose to live your purpose.

P.S. If you are on a path of self-enlightment or simply curious or both, here is a food for thought - Does a well-meaning, well-defined purpose feel like a trap, freedom restricting, imprisonment i.e. will it make you unhappy until you achieve your purpose?
