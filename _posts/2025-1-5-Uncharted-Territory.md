***Awareness Awakened, Fresh Start Achieved!***

Alright, let's cut to the chase. I'm not sure about you but last three years I've been navigating my own "uncharted territory." Whether it's a new project at work (transitioned back to development from security), a life change (moving to TX a year ago), or just trying to figure out what the heck is going on, I've been in a constant state of discovery.

For me, this blog is that discovery. It's about hitting the reset button, taking a good hard look in the mirror, and figuring out how to lead – myself and maybe others – a little better.

Here are the outcomes I expect from all the research that'll go into sharing my thoughts:
* ***Become a better leader***: Continuous reflections about leadership forces you to clarify your thoughts, identify patterns in your behavior, and confront your biases. I hope this process leads to deeper self-awareness and general improvement in my abilities to lead a global team.
* ***Become a better communicator***: Writing and expressing complex ideas sharpens your ability to communicate effectively. I hope the improvement in articulation of my thoughts will prove beneficial from the perspective of leadership, relationships, and overall ability to convey my thoughts clearly and persuasively.

A quick anecdote from Jainism (religion I grew up with):
> King Shrenik, a powerful ruler, often sought wisdom from Lord Mahavir. In one instance, he asked about the nature of the soul and the universe. Lord Mahavir, through his profound awareness, provided answers that shifted the king's perspective, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all living beings (watch the [video](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3101444202851667187/5009015382723037676#) to understand more about Jainism and it's teachings). Through his interactions, King Shrenik underwent significant self-reflection, leading to a gradual shift from a power-driven ruler to a more ethically conscious leader; from accumulating power or possessions to serving others with detachment; listening to diverse perspectives and avoiding dogmatism; demonstrating discipline & restraint and prioritizing compassion.

To put this in software engineering terms best I can: King Shrenik's journey resembles a leader who initially prioritizes robust growth and immediate results (why - maybe to impress his/her manager, prove they are capable, etc.). However, under the guidance of a wise mentor, Lord Mahavira, he undergoes a significant refactoring process. He learns to prioritize writing clean and maintainable code, and adopts a team-centric approach, focusing on the well-being of his team. He moves from a single-threaded, performance-driven mindset to a multi-threaded, sustainable leadership style, recognizing the interconnectedness of all stakeholders and the long-term impact of his decisions, ultimately becoming a more responsible and effective leader.

P.S. I leverage AI tools (mostly Gemini or Grok) to help me refine my thoughts.
