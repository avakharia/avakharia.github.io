| One Day Smarter | Emily Winter | One Day Smarter is a delightful, trivia-packed book filled with quirky and uplifting facts designed to spark joy. The author being a comedian beautifully blends humor with fascinating tidbits. It’s like a "treasure trove of trivia". However, occasionally I found facts to be too random or niche and was wishing for a bit more depth in certain topics. Overall, it’s a charming, light read for trivia buffs and anyone seeking a fun, feel-good knowledge boost. | Awkward Date | [amazon](https://amzn.to/3Rts6Uz) |
| Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk | Peter L. Bernstein | Unfortunately, I did not take notes. | Big Snooze | [amazon](https://amzn.to/4jxCO8P) |
