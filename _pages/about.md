Hi, I'm Atit and I live in the Sports City. I'm a son, a brother, a husband and most importantly a father of two beautiful kiddos. I lead global engineering teams for Expedia. I recently started writing about my experiences in various topics in leadership with the hope to share not only my perspective but also to encourage a dialogue. I can't wait to learn from the community along this journey.

***Personal Motto***: In a world full of trends, I want to remain a classic!
