Hi, I'm Atit and I live in the Sports City. I'm a son, a brother, a husband and most importantly a father of two beautiful kiddos. I recently started writing about my leadership experiences with the hope to share not only my perspective but also to encourage a dialogue. I can't wait to learn from the community along this journey.

[Here](https://sagical.com/2025/01/Uncharted-Territory.html) is my 1st post on this journey.

> In a world full of trends, I want to remain a classic!
