Hi, I'm Atit and I live in the Sports City. I'm a son, a brother, a husband and most important a father of two beautiful kiddos. I lead global engineering teams for Expedia and lately I started writing about leadership (so far) based on my 8+ years of experiences leading teams.

***Personal Motto***: In a world full of trends, I want to remain a classic!
